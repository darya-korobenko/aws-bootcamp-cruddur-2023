# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Homework

### Create a new User and Generate AWS Credentials

- I used IAM User groups Console to create a new user group *admin*. During the set up of *admin* group I attached *AdministratorAccess* policy to it.
- Then I went to IAM Users Console to create a new user *daria-bootcamp*. During the set up of *daria-bootcamp* user I assigned it to the *admin* group.
- Following that, I started working on additional setting for *daria-bootcamp* user. I went to Security Credentianls tab and, just to be on a safe side, assigned MFA device to it. After that I created a new access key to be able to access my AWS account through CLI.

I also added an alias to my AWS account though IAM Dashboard-AWS Account to make the sign-in for my IAM users easier in the future.

### Install and Verify AWS CLI 

I installed the AWS CLI on Gitpod, following a set of commands provided in [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). To make it easier to debug the CLI commands, I also set AWS CLI to use partial autoprompt mode.

To automate these manual steps so that a new environment can be set up repeatedly by Gitpod, I defined *tasks* in the *.gitpod.yml* configuration file:
```
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

Following that I set my AWS credentials as environment variables, which let me have the persistent variables in my workspace that could be used in the code:
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="___"
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="___"
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-central-1"
```

After that I verified that AWS CLI is working with the expected user:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
Indeed, everything was set up correctly:

Just in case of a future need, I also installed AWS CLI on my laptop by following the same instructions sited earlier but for Windows OS.

### Enable Billing

I went to Account settings in my root account and activated IAM access to billing information.

I also opened Billing page and under Billing preferences chose Receive Billing Alerts specifying my email.

### Create Billing Alarm

I created SNS Topic called *billing-alarm* using Gitpod:
```
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
Then I subscribed my email to this topic:
```
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn XXX \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint XXX@gmail.com
```

Then I confirmed the subscription via email and checked that everything works with the help of AWS Console:

Following [AWS Documentation Page](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/), I created a billing alarm called *DailyEstimatedCharges* that would be triggered in case the daily estimated charges exceed 1$.

First, I had to create *alarm_config.json* file. The only modifications done in the file were changing the amount of dollars to 1 and adding the TopicARN that was generated earlier.

Then the following command was run:
```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```

Following that I confirmed that everything works with the help of AWS Console:

### Create AWS Budget

I followed [AWS Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html#examples) to set up a new monthly AWS budget of 1$ using Gitpod.

In order to do that, two new json files were created as described in the documentation (only an amount of dollars was modified and email replaced).

To get my AWS Account ID the following command was run:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

Then I created a new environmental variable *AWS_ACCOUNT_ID*:
```
gp env AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="___"
```
After that the following *create-budget* command was run and my monthly budget was set up:

Following that I confirmed that everything worked with the help of AWS Console:

## Challenges

### Set MFA for Root Acccount and Create IAM Role

I set up MFA for my root account and stopped using it as my newly created *daria-bootcamp* user had all the required permissions.

![MFA for Root User](/_docs/assets/MFA_root.png)

I also created IAM role *DemoRoleForEC2* for EC2 instances and attached *IAMReadOnlyAccess* policy to it.

### Use EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS

Following a set of instructions provided in [AWS Documentation Page](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/sns-email-notifications-eventbridge/), I created a new health topic in SNS and subscribed my email to it.

![SNS health topic](/_docs/assets/sns.png)

Following a set of instructions provided in [AWS Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html), I used EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS, so that in the future I will be able to receive notifications whenever there is a service health issue.

Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool (No specialized lens)

Create an architectural diagram (to the best of your ability) the CI/CD logical pipeline in Lucid Charts

Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility. 

### Open Support Case

With the help of AWS Support Console, I opened a new support ticket and requested to increase the service limit for SNS.
